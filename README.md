# Vehicle Animation Simulator

This project is a web-based hub for exploring 3D simulations of various vehicles using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).  
Each simulation features unique visual effects and physical behaviors.

## 🔗 Simulations Included

| Vehicle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🚆 **Train** | A train running through a dynamic environment with adjustable camera angles. |
| 🚢 **Ship** | A boat floating realistically on procedurally generated waves using Perlin noise. |
| ✈️ **Airplane** | A flying bird-like aircraft flapping its wings while moving through the sky. |

All simulations are implemented in **single-file HTML** format and run fully on the browser (no server required).

## 💡 Tech Stack

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering
- Procedural noise (Perlin) for terrain and waves
- Custom animations and object hierarchies for articulated movement
- Vanilla JavaScript, mobile-friendly UI

## 🧠 Inspiration

The project aims to demonstrate how **interactive visual simulations** can be built in a no-code-like, modular fashion using large language models and JavaScript frameworks.  
This "digital plastic model" experience helps bridge abstract supply chain and logistics concepts with intuitive, visual storytelling.

Created with the help of [ChatGPT + o3-based visual prototyping].  
Inspired by the joy of building things that move — just like plastic models from childhood.
